# VBA-Challenge

The VBA of Wall Street

This is a project to use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.  

The objectives are to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting also appears in the price change column that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
